## ‚ú® Features

One of the key features of our project is budget selectivity through database integration. You can choose your travel destinations based on your budget preferences, ensuring you find the best options within your desired price range. Our database includes various packages, allowing you to view detailed pricing for adults and children, helping you make informed decisions.

For instant assistance, our chatbot, powered by a Flask application, is at your service. The chatbox feature provides immediate help and answers to your travel-related queries, ensuring you have support whenever you need it.

To enhance your travel experience, we've integrated various APIs. The YouTube API allows you to watch travel videos directly from YouTube, giving you a visual glimpse of your destinations. Additionally, the Weather API provides real-time weather forecasts for your selected destinations, helping you plan your trips accordingly.

The Tourism Guide Project is designed to be your ultimate travel companion, making it easier for you to plan, explore, and enjoy your trips. We hope you find it helpful and enjoy using our platform as much as we enjoyed creating it for you.
